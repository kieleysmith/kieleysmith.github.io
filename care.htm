	  <h1>Caring for Your Pet</h1>
	  
	<a href="https://www.petfinder.com/pet-adoption/dog-adoption/pets-as-presents/"><img src="puppy_gift.jpg" title="Seasonal Adoption Awareness" alt="image of a puppy recieving a gift" /></a>
	<h3>Follow the image link to learn about Christmas adoptions, pros and cons.</h3>
	
	<h2>General Maintenance</h2>
         <p>When you first adopt an animal, the learning curve can be a bit steep.  To make sure that your new family member fits in right from the start, we 
		 have compiled a list of general resources to help out.  
         </p>  
	<p>First of all, some basic information about the care and keeping of your new pet is in order:
		For cats: <a href="http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/">kittenrescue.org's Kitten Care Handbook provides instructions to care for cats from birth to adulthood.</a>
		<br><br>For dogs: <a href="http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/caring-animal-companions/dogs/">PETA also has good general care guidelines for dogs, some obvious, some not.</a>
	</p>
		 
		

         <h2>Spay and Neuter</h2>
         <p>In order to keep animals off the streets by preventing unwanted pregnancies, it is important to spay and neuter your pets.  <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/spay-neuter.aspx">This proceedure, explained by the AVMA veteranary organization, </a>
				represents a large portion of what we do at the SPCA, and moves us closer to achieving a euthanasia-free world.
         </p>
		 
	<h2>Training Your Dog</h2>
         <p>If you adopted a puppy or just want to teach an old dog new tricks, training makes life a lot easier!  Training provides your dog with a behavioural framework
		 that will keep them out of trouble, as well as giving you bonding time with your pet. <a href="http://dogs.about.com/od/dogtraining/ss/Dog-Training-101-Essential-Steps-To-Train-Your-Dog.htm#step2">About.com provides a great overview of how to tackle first-time training.</a>
