				<h2>Introduction and Definition of Trend</h2>
			</div>
				<p>
					Web Typography is the use of lettering to convey a website's message in a way beyond simple blocks of text.  Type is uniquely able to make content "pop", 
					and through the use of uniquely arranged sizing of letters,
					positioning of words, and varied font styles, some web standard, some created by graphic designers, web pages have become far more effective 
					at grabbing and holding viewer's attention. <br><br>
					
					Consequently, now there are so many tools floating around to make text pretty, buliding a bland, utilitarian website has become uncompetative. 
					No organization wants to seem obsolete, and a lot of thought goes into choosing the perfect design for a page's written content.  <br><br>
					
					Increasingly stylized, unique fonts and arrangement of text components has become commonplace, so it is important to familiarize
					oneself with current typography trends to stay relevant.

				<p>
						Typographic design is a largely visual subject, relying upon the relationship of the size, positioning, color, and style of the text.<br><br>
						Because of this, the most effective way to improve familiarity with this exciting trend is to provide examples of web typography done well:<br><br>
						
						Firstly, an enormous amount of typographic design focuses of using highly expressive fonts in conjunction with artistic images to 
						create bold, attention-grabbing pages. <br>
						<a href="http://www.awwwards.com/websites/typography/" style="text-decoration:none" rel="external">This website provides great examples of artistic design.</a> <br><br>
						
						Next on the list is typography that focuses on the text itself, and endeavors to make the website's message shine clearly through the use of 
						carefully selected fonts, designed to be the center of focus on the page. <br>  
						<a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/20-typography-trends-to-pay-attention-to-in-2016" style="text-decoration:none" rel="external">
						Good examples of these fonts </a> and explanations of their history and use can be found all over the web! <br><br>
						
						Finally, There are the web fonts that cross the line between art and communication, fonts that designers should be aware of so that 
						they never find themselves trapped in a box.<br>
						These fonts offer designs like

				<h2>Trend Support</h2>
			</div>
				<p>
						When talking about whether web typography is supported by a certain browser, the answer can get a little bit murky.
						for example: simply using a standard web font, and putting an interesting twist on it with varied sizing, spacing, etc, can 
						be a highly effective design solution, and come across as fresh, worthy contribution to the trend of pushing typography to its limits.<br><br>
						
						However, the main compatibility problem that may crop up is the issue of custom fonts, the formats in which they are stored,  
						and which browsers are equipped to handle them.<br><br>
						
						As of 2016, the most common font formats used to store unusual letters are TTF (TrueType) OTF(OpenType), and WOFF(Web Open Font Format).  
						These formats are supported accross the most recent editions of the major browsers, such as Chrome, I.E., and Firefox, 
						but there are also less commonly supported formats, such as Embedded OpenType fonts, which only work on Internet Explorer. <br><br>
						
						In conclusion, as long as one uses a widely recognized font and is designing a website to be viewed in relatively up-to-date browsers, 
						one is free to use the vast majority of fun typography tricks!  And the nice thing about font is that more widely supported fonts can be
						queued up for the older browsers to use, so the page's content won't suffer due to browser incompatibility.
